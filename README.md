# comptianetworkplus

This repository serves as a hands-on learning laboratory designed to reinforce fundamental networking concepts, particularly those relevant to the CompTIA Network+ certification. Through practical Python projects, the learner can explore key topics such as binary conversions, IPv4 addressing, and subnetting.

## Features

Currently, this lab includes modules for:

*   **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: A Python script (`Bin_2_dec.py`) to convert binary numbers to their decimal equivalents.
*   **IPv4 Decimal to Binary Converter**: A Python script (`IPv4_Dec_2_Bin.py`) to convert IPv4 addresses from decimal dotted-quad notation to binary.

## Setup

To get started with these learning labs, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/comptianetworkplus.git
    cd comptianetworkplus
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **No external dependencies currently**: The projects are designed to use standard Python libraries.

## Usage

Navigate to the specific lab directory and run the Python script.

**Example: Binary to Decimal Conversion**

```bash
cd Labs/Binary To Decimal/
python3 Bin_2_dec.py
```

**Example: IPv4 Decimal to Binary Converter**

```bash
cd Labs/IPv4 Dec to Bin Converter/
python3 IPv4_Dec_2_Bin.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the scripts.

## Tech Stack

*   **Python**: The primary programming language used for all lab exercises.

## Learning Philosophy

This project adheres to a specific learning philosophy, prioritizing clarity and step-by-step understanding. For more details on the teaching style and coding expectations, please refer to the [GEMINI.md](https://github.com/nickngarcia/comptianetworkplus/blob/main/GEMINI.md) file.

## Development Environment

This learning lab was developed using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) as a virtual development environment. GitHub Codespaces provides a secure and cloud-based setup, allowing for development directly from your browser.

The [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli) was utilized within this Codespace environment. This approach allows the Gemini CLI to interact with the project code without requiring installation on a local machine, enhancing security and streamlining the development workflow.
